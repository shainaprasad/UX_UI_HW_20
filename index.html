            <p class="higher-education">
              Higher education institutions have a few key questions they need answered for optimal student success,
              such as: how do we improve academic intervention? how do we better support our students of color? how do
              we provide more financial resources to low-income attendees? how can we increase graduation rates and
              retention? what needs to be changed to improve overall university experience?<br /><br />That’s where the
              Senior Exit Survey comes in, administered annually from January 1st through December 31st, it explores
              students’ academic and co-curricular experiences at San Francisco State University. The study is conducted
              on an ongoing basis to undergraduate students who are seniors intending to graduate within the calendar
              year to gain intel on their overall experience, close administrator knowledge gaps, and make
              university-wide changes.

              The Senior Exit Survey is adapted annually based on student groups and needs at the time. The survey is
              analyzed in the first quarter of the following year using SQL and R to cross reference student data
              (student ID, demographics, major, etc.) with survey responses. Text analyses are conducted for open-ended
              responses as well. Next, key pain points are identified and a 5-year trend report is populated. These
              reports are then shared with key stakeholders such as provosts, deans, professors, and program directors
              to make equitable improvements campus-wide through direct student input.

            <p class="text-wrapper-5">
              2022 survey completion rose by 49% from 2021, which is optimistic for newly implemented outreach efforts.
              The study could be expanded to a wider audience, such as parents and instructors, for a more comprehensive
              understanding of overall campus experience. Conducting focus groups to cross-reference with quantitative
              data would provide more accurate and exhaustive feedback. Outreach strategies could be improved for even
              greater participation.

            <p class="text-wrapper-6">
              Some challenges include lack of diversity in participant pool, the survey period not being aligned with
              the academic year, and restricted access to resources for more comprehensive study. There was no way to
              control for COVID-19 with its significant negative impact on student experience.
