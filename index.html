                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Higher education institutions have a few key questions they need answered for optimal student success, 
                          such as: how do we improve academic intervention? how do we better support our students of color? how do 
                          we provide more financial resources to low-income attendees? how can we increase graduation rates and 
                          retention? what needs to be changed to improve overall university experience?

                          That’s where the Senior Exit Survey comes in, administered annually from January 1st through December 31st, 
                          it explores students’ academic and co-curricular experiences at San Francisco State University. The study is 
                          conducted on an ongoing basis to undergraduate students who are seniors intending to graduate within the 
                          calendar year to gain intel on their overall experience, close administrator knowledge gaps, and make university-wide changes.</p>

                      <h2>Process</h2>
                      <p>The Senior Exit Survey is adapted annually based on student groups and 
                        needs at the time. The survey is analyzed in the first quarter of the 
                        following year using SQL and R to cross reference student data (student ID, 
                        demographics, major, etc.) with survey responses. Text analyses are 
                        conducted for open-ended responses as well. Next, key pain points are 
                        identified and a 5-year trend report is populated. These reports are then 
                        shared with key stakeholders such as provosts, deans, professors, and 
                        program directors to make equitable improvements campus-wide through direct student input.</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Discovered overall high student satisfaction (above 80%)
                          Closed administrator knowledge gaps
                          Made tangible campus recommendations (provide better financial literacy options and 
                          increase course offerings)
                          Improved graduation rates</li>
                        <li>Identified primary improvement areas (course availability, COVID-19, and 
                          advising/infrastructure issues)</li>
                        <li>Closed administrator knowledge gaps</li>
                        <li>Made tangible campus recommendations (provide better financial literacy options and 
                          increase course offerings)</li>

                    <article>
                      <h2>Reflection</h2>
                      <p>2022 survey completion rose by 49% from 2021, which is optimistic for newly implemented 
                        outreach efforts. The study could be expanded to a wider audience, such as parents and instructors, 
                        for a more comprehensive understanding of overall campus experience. Conducting focus groups to 
                        cross-reference with quantitative data would provide more accurate and exhaustive feedback. Outreach 
                        strategies could be improved for even greater participation.</p>

                      <h2>Challenges/Limitations</h2>
                      <p>Some challenges include lack of diversity in participant pool, the survey period not being aligned 
                        with the academic year, and restricted access to resources for more comprehensive study. There was no 
                        way to control for COVID-19 with its significant negative impact on student experience.</p>
